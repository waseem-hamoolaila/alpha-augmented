# Packages

A small project to visualize a fitting algorithm aiming to reduce the 
wasted space and place the packages inside the created box. 

It allows you to:

- Customize the main box by defining the dimensions
- tweak the behavior of the algorithm by setting (direction - rotation - pov)

# How to install the project locally

* The project built using Django framework, so it follows the same deploying instructions
* Clone the repo
* Create a virtual environment: python > 3.9
